COMP 373 Databases Final Project: Database Driven Web Application

This repository represents a mock university database. 
In order to run this program and web application: 

- Download the following files into a folder 'database'
- Move the folder into XAMPP/htdocs
- Go to http://localhost/databases/index.php in your browser

While navigating on the web application you will be able to add a course to the database, find a course, register as a student, enroll yourself into a class, and drop a class. 

When browsing the already existing courses, you will be presented with a table and all the information about the course you are looking for.

On this project worked Dyani Dillard, Anna Nefedenkova, and Scott Morris.
